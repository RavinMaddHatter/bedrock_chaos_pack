# bedrock_chaos_pack
This is a community project, please do submit pull request as you want. the way it works is you add functions to the function folder (and modify the entities you need to modify). Then run the python script "chaos maker.py" and it will generate the chaos controller. The chaos controller will call a random function every 90 seconds. The time is configruable in the python script. This is just a fun project. 

## Goal

I want to have a speed run event some day, i need to get AT LEAST 100 functions in that pack to make the speed run possible. There will be some number of players on a fresh world, we will try and kill the dragon as a team

## Function rules

Functions should hava a finite run time, They should not happen outside of when the chaos controller calls them, and they should not break the world. but other than that it is pretty much fair game. I have some that change world spawn, i have some that instant kill the player, i have some that are nice. Having a mix of trivial ones and crazy ones makes the game more chaotic.
